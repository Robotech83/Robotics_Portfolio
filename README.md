# 🤖 Sonny — Offline Humanoid Robotics Portfolio

**Status:** Prototype / Active Development  
**Focus:** Robotics Systems • Embedded Software • Perception • Human–Robot Interaction

This repository contains my **robotics portfolio and digital twin environment**, built to design, test, and demonstrate an **offline humanoid robot** named **Sonny**.  
The project emphasizes **real-world robotics workflows**: partial hardware, debugging under constraints, simulation-first development, and modular system design.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

Sonny is an **offline humanoid robotics platform** designed to explore how perception, voice interaction, motion control, and diagnostics work together in a real robot system.

The portfolio serves as:
- a **digital twin** for hardware-in-progress
- a **control interface** similar to internal robotics dashboards
- a **proof-of-knowledge** artifact for robotics and embedded systems roles

## 📊 System Status

This project is intentionally transparent about development state.

- ✅ Face detection & object detection working
- ✅ Offline voice pipeline functional
- 🟡 Motion control limited by current hardware availability
- 🟡 Kinematics tools actively iterating
- ⏸ Some physical components pending repair or redesign

A full system status overview is available inside the portfolio UI.

## 🎯 Development Philosophy

This project prioritizes **engineering realism over cosmetic completeness**.

Hardware failures, incomplete assemblies, and limited resources are treated as part of the design process. When hardware is unavailable, development continues through simulation, modular testing, and virtual tools.
