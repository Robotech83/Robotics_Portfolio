MY ROBOT PROJECT

Goal:
I want to move my robot arm on a screen and have the computer
figure out the joint angles.

What I have:
- An InMoov robot
- A Blender model
- Raspberry Pi + Arduino
- Some Python knowledge

What I am learning:
- Blender (slowly)
- Robot movement math


New word: JOINT

A joint is a place where one part of the robot rotates.

Examples:
- Shoulder
- Elbow
- Wrist


New word: ANGLE

An angle is how far a joint has rotated.

Examples:
- Elbow bent a little
- Elbow bent a lot
- Elbow straight
